# HatchWorks AI Code Challenge

This is my submission for the HatchWorks AI Code Challenge.

## Overview

I built a small iOS app that fetches country information from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com).

The app has **2 tabs**:

- **Countries**: Shows a list of countries. When you tap a country, you can see a **detail screen** with more information.
- **Favorites**: Shows the countries you’ve added to your favorites list.

Favorites are saved locally on the device, so they stay available after closing and reopening the app.

## API Used

- REST Countries: https://restcountries.com
